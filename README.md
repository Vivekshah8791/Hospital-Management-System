## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or Download** the project folder
2. Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your system
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in the project directory
4. Run the application using:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧠 How the System Works

* `main.py` acts as the **controller**, coordinating all modules
* Each module (`doctor.py`, `patient.py`, `appointment.py`) handles a **specific responsibility**
* `database.py` manages all data-related operations to keep logic centralized

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* ✅ Add GUI using **Tkinter / PyQt**
* ✅ Integrate **SQLite / MySQL** database
* ✅ User authentication (Admin / Doctor / Receptionist)
* ✅ Billing and payment system
* ✅ Report generation

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Practical understanding of **Python OOP concepts**
* Experience in **real-world project structure**
* Improved skills in **modular coding and debugging**
